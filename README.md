# Mimic-arm-movement-using-thingy

I use a web application to read thingy data using web bluetooth API, then write that data to a JSON file.
I have a ros node running that listens to chnages in the JSON file and use that data to move a simulated arm in Rviz.

TODO: Instead of reading thingy data using web bluetooth API, use bluetooth socket or QtBluetooth
